      The definition for the <strong>Environmental Art</strong> has not yet
      crystallized. Environmental Art is usually seen as a kind of Art connected
      with nature, but is not just this. Environmental Art is also an expression
      of a specific natural, urban and / or cultural context. Environmental
      artists tend to use various techniques to create a place that can also be
      a meaningful site. They often use installations and sculptures, but we can
      also see a few environmental artworks created as murales or massive
      drawings filling entire walls of a building!
      <br />
      <br />
      Environmental Art looks into the culture, the soul of a place, whatever it
      is an urban or natural landscape. In this kind of Art, the environment is
      seen as a mix of cultural and natural elements and the artist tries to
      create a deeper connection between these elements and his artwork. This
      connection is usually based on the folk traditions, the history or the
      geographical nature of the place where the artwork will be sited. It is
      not a clear connection, written on a display or paper. It is a silent
      connection, barely perceptible, but able to involve all of your senses,
      until feeling as if it was speaking directly to you. Once you get its
      value and what the artwork is trying to convey, you will already be so
      much connected with everything around you, that it will be as if you have
      always known that place.
      <br />
      <br />
      Environmental artworks are recently more popular than before. However,
      they are not so easy to see and understand. For this reason, I would like
      to show you an example of environmental artwork.

      <em>The Ciclope</em> is one of the twelve sculptures created by Angelo
      Casciello, a contemporary italian artist, for the exhibition

      in Pompei (NA), Italy in the last 2017. The exhibition was an itinerary
      between history and the contemporary age. The history of the
      archaeological park of Pompei is not just the tale of a tragedy, but also
      the place where life has become eternal through form from the capitals,
      sculptures, cornices and walls of the ancient buildings. In this project
      these architectural elements were compared with Casciello's works with
      their extraordinary sculptural-architectural force and their relation to
      their surroundings. Visitors could see volumetric works of plain or
      painted iron, solid metal structures alternating with dense, monolithic
      totem-like masses reminiscent of an archaic era. Casciello’s sculptures
      were created and exhibited there to encourage reflection on the
      rediscovered city and on the passing of time that has turned Pompei into
      an eternal image, as well as reflection on the role of contemporary
      languages of art.
